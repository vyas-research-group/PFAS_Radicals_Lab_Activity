### TODO  
  
**Student/Instructor Materials**  
* [ ] test final integration of materials - can someone open them and walk through the activity?  
* [ ] are all necessary files included?  
  - re-make the MO files at lower resolution and appropriate iso values  
  - should the utilities folder be moved to the instructor folder, and should we keep the density of states plot generation info?  
  - are we allowed to publish ORCA output files?  
* [ ] add question to comment a function that is fully written  
* [ ] add question to ask a gen AI to write a function and compare  
  
**Manuscript**
* [ ] detailed outline  
* [ ] introduction  
  - review of CURE's
  - review of other computational chem activities 
  - review of CX3 radicals  
  - review of eductaional methods (learning cycle?)  
  - justification of ORCA and small system  
* [ ] body
  - timing information (both for students completing activity and for calculation times)  
  - more information on mulliken pop analysis?  
  - description of the activities and intended use (partners?)   
* [ ] supporting information  
  - additional files / scripts from jacob about the other CX3 radicals? how is this appropriate to integrate?  
  
**Presentation(s)**
* [ ] JChemEd
  - intro slides (review of other ed projects)
  - PFAS are relevant slide, degradation through radicals  
  - programming is an essential skill (data about this from a paper?)  
  - ORCA is a good program, CX3 radical is a good system  
  - clear statement of purpose and learning outcomes!  
  - walk through activity  
  - tie back into learning outcomes, mention assessment ideas...  
* [ ] Env. Chem  
  - PFAS are bad (mention medical applications)  
  - most degradation occurs through radicals  
  - interesting observation / debate in the literature  
    - historical timeline of CX3 studies...  
  - no recent publications  
  - we examined bond sweeps and different parameters  
    - show that each of the itnermediate parameters aren't useful  
  - reconnect to orbital interaction diagram  
  - show how this diagram is wrong / simplified  
    - introduce density of states plot (brief explanation of mulliken pop analysis)  
    - show orbital shapes to connect the two  
    - show how the orbital diagram is different  
  - connect to reactivity  
    - scans of redox potential, describe deformation to enhance / stabilize different ox states  
      - can we stimulate appropriate IR stretches to enhance degradation efficiency in aqueous electron systems? (CHECK IF THIS HAS BEEN DONE)
