#### Density of States Plot  
---
This folder contains the code needed to generate the density of states plot used in the student activity.  
Data text files were generated from the Mulliken populaton analysis and the optimized geometry \*.gbw files in the program [Multiwfn](http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/).  
  
This code should never be needed, but is included for completeness.
